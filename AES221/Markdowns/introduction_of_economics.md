## **MAIN TOPICS EXPLAINED**

This economics chapter covers everything together ‚Äî step by step, just like you asked. We'll start with a brief **introduction**, then go serially through each topic in clear, friendly language. Economics is the study of human behavior related to **unlimited wants** and **limited resources** with **alternative uses**.

‚úÖ **Key idea:** Economics helps us understand how to manage resources to satisfy human wants.

## **POSITIVE VS NORMATIVE ECONOMICS**

Economics can be studied from two different perspectives:

#### **Positive Economics**
- **Definition:** Describes and explains economic phenomena as they actually are
- **Characteristics:**
  - Deals with **facts and reality**
  - Can be tested and verified
  - Objective and scientific
  - Uses phrases like "is," "was," "will be"
- **Examples:**
  - "Bangladesh's GDP growth rate was 7.1% in 2022"
  - "Unemployment rate in Dhaka is 12%"
  - "When price of tea increases, demand for coffee increases"

#### **Normative Economics**
- **Definition:** Suggests what economic policies should be implemented
- **Characteristics:**
  - Deals with **opinions and values**
  - Cannot be tested objectively
  - Subjective and based on judgment
  - Uses phrases like "should be," "ought to be," "better"
- **Examples:**
  - "Bangladesh should reduce income inequality"
  - "Government ought to increase minimum wage"
  - "Rich people should pay higher taxes"

#### **Key Differences:**

| **Positive Economics** | **Normative Economics** |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| What **IS**            | What **SHOULD BE**      |
| Facts and data         | Opinions and values     |
| Objective              | Subjective              |
| Can be tested          | Cannot be tested        |
| Descriptive            | Prescriptive            |

#### **Relationship:**
- Positive economics provides the **foundation** for normative economics
- Policy makers use positive analysis to make normative decisions
- Both are essential for complete economic understanding

## **9. DISTRIBUTION**

#### **Definition:**
Distribution refers to how the **total wealth and income generated in an economy** is shared among the different factors of production and social groups.

#### **Two Types of Distribution:**

##### **A. Functional Distribution**
How income is distributed among the **factors of production**:

| **Factor of Production** | **Type of Income** | **Explanation** | **Example** |
|--------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Land** | **Rent** | Payment for use of natural resources | Agricultural land rent: 20,000 Tk/acre/year |
| **Labor** | **Wages/Salary** | Payment for human work and skills | Garment worker: 15,000 Tk/month |
| **Capital** | **Interest** | Payment for use of money/equipment | Bank loan interest: 10% per year |
| **Organization** | **Profit** | Reward for entrepreneurship and risk | Business profit after all costs |

##### **B. Personal Distribution**
How total national income is distributed among **different individuals and households**:
- **Rich vs. Poor:** Income inequality measurement
- **Urban vs. Rural:** Geographic income differences
- **Skilled vs. Unskilled:** Education-based income gaps

#### **Factors Affecting Distribution:**

##### **1. Market Forces:**
- Supply and demand for different skills
- Competition among employers
- Productivity differences

##### **2. Government Policies:**
- **Progressive Taxation:** Higher tax rates for rich
- **Minimum Wage Laws:** Protecting low-income workers
- **Social Safety Nets:** Support for poor families
- **Education Investment:** Improving skills for better jobs

##### **3. Social Factors:**
- Access to education and healthcare
- Discrimination based on gender, region, etc.
- Cultural attitudes toward work

#### **Distribution Problems:**
- **Income Inequality:** Gap between rich and poor
- **Regional Imbalance:** Dhaka vs. rural areas
- **Gender Pay Gap:** Men vs. women earnings
- **Skill Premium:** High pay for educated workers

#### **Measuring Distribution:**
- **Gini Coefficient:** 0 (perfect equality) to 1 (perfect inequality)
- **Income Quintiles:** Dividing population into 5 equal groups by income

#### **Bangladesh Context:**
- Agricultural workers get low wages
- Garment industry provides jobs but low pay
- IT sector offers higher salaries
- Rickshaw pullers earn daily wages

It's how wealth is **shared** among:

* Landowners ‚Üí rent
* Workers ‚Üí wages
* Capitalists ‚Üí interest
* Entrepreneurs ‚Üí profit

## **8. CONSUMPTION**

#### **Definition:**
‚úÖ **Consumption is the process of using goods and services to satisfy human wants, which results in the destruction or reduction of their utility.**

#### **Key Characteristics:**
- **Utility Destruction:** The main feature of consumption
- **Want Satisfaction:** Primary purpose
- **Final Use:** End point of economic activity
- **Value Destruction:** Unlike production, consumption destroys economic value

#### **Types of Consumption:**

##### **A. Based on Durability:**
1. **Durable Consumption:** 
   - Goods last for a long time
   - Utility is consumed gradually
   - Examples: Car, house, furniture
   
2. **Non-durable Consumption:**
   - Goods are consumed quickly
   - Utility destroyed in one use
   - Examples: Food, fuel, medicine

##### **B. Based on Nature:**
1. **Direct Consumption:**
   - Satisfies wants directly
   - Examples: Eating food, wearing clothes
   
2. **Indirect Consumption:**
   - Helps in further production
   - Examples: Farmer eating food to work, fuel for transport

##### **C. Based on Necessity:**
1. **Productive Consumption:**
   - Consumption for further production
   - Examples: Raw materials, worker's food
   
2. **Unproductive Consumption:**
   - Consumption for direct satisfaction
   - Examples: Entertainment, luxury items

#### **Consumption vs. Destruction:**
- **Consumption:** Purposeful use for satisfaction
- **Destruction:** Accidental or wasteful loss

#### **Examples of Different Consumption:**
- üçµ Drinking tea ‚Üí **Complete consumption** (tea is gone)
- üöó Using a car ‚Üí **Partial consumption** (car depreciates)
- üìö Reading a book ‚Üí **Utility consumption** (book remains but knowledge extracted)
- üî• Burning wood for heat ‚Üí **Physical consumption** (wood becomes ash)

#### **Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility in Consumption:**
As you consume more units of the same good, each additional unit gives less satisfaction than the previous one.

E.g. Drinking tea ‚Üí it's gone, its utility is used up.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Deals with **facts and reality**
  - Can be tested and verified
  - Objective and scientific
  - Uses phrases like "is," "was," "will be"
- **Examples:**
  - "Bangladesh's GDP growth rate was 7.1% in 2022"
  - "Unemployment rate in Dhaka is 12%"
  - "When price of tea increases, demand for coffee increases"

#### **Normative Economics**
- **Definition:** Suggests what economic policies should be implemented
- **Characteristics:**
  - Deals with **opinions and values**
  - Cannot be tested objectively
  - Subjective and based on judgment
  - Uses phrases like "should be," "ought to be," "better"
- **Examples:**
  - "Bangladesh should reduce income inequality"
  - "Government ought to increase minimum wage"
  - "Rich people should pay higher taxes"

#### **Key Differences:**

| **Positive Economics** | **Normative Economics** |
|------------------------|-------------------------|
| What **IS** | What **SHOULD BE** |
| Facts and data | Opinions and values |
| Objective | Subjective |
| Can be tested | Cannot be tested |
| Descriptive | Prescriptive |

#### **Relationship:**
- Positive economics provides the **foundation** for normative economics
- Policy makers use positive analysis to make normative decisions
- Both are essential for complete economic understanding

* **Positive:** Describes facts ‚Äî *what is* (e.g. "Population of Bangladesh is X")
* **Normative:** Suggests policies ‚Äî *what should be* (e.g. "Bangladesh's population should be lower.")

## **METHODS IN ECONOMICS**

There are two main logical approaches to study economic phenomena:

#### **A. Deductive Method (Top-down approach)**
- **Process:** General principle ‚Üí Specific application
- **Steps:**
  1. Start with a general economic theory or law
  2. Make specific assumptions
  3. Apply logical reasoning
  4. Reach specific conclusions
- **Example:** 
  - General law: "When price increases, demand decreases" (Law of Demand)
  - Application: "If rice price increases from 50 to 60 Tk/kg, people will buy less rice"
- **Advantages:** Quick, logical, cost-effective
- **Disadvantages:** Depends on accuracy of assumptions

#### **B. Inductive Method (Bottom-up approach)**
- **Process:** Specific observations ‚Üí General conclusion
- **Steps:**
  1. Collect real-world data and facts
  2. Observe patterns and relationships
  3. Analyze the data statistically
  4. Form general economic principles
- **Example:**
  - Observe: Survey 1000 families about their income and spending
  - Pattern: Higher income families save more percentage of income
  - Conclusion: "As income increases, marginal propensity to save increases"
- **Advantages:** Based on real facts, more reliable
- **Disadvantages:** Time-consuming, expensive, limited scope

#### **Modern Approach:**
Most economists today use **both methods together** - starting with theory (deductive) and testing it with real data (inductive).

* **Deductive Method:** Start with a general rule ‚Üí apply it to specific cases.
  (e.g. "All men are mortal" ‚Üí "Rahim is mortal.")

* **Inductive Method:** Start from real-life cases ‚Üí create a general conclusion.
  (e.g. Survey students ‚Üí conclude about English proficiency.)

## **IS ECONOMICS A SCIENCE?**

**Yes, Economics is considered a social science**, but it has unique characteristics:

#### **Scientific Aspects of Economics:**
- **Systematic Study:** Uses organized methods to study economic phenomena
- **Observation:** Economists observe real-world economic behavior
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Economic theories are tested against real data
- **Prediction:** Economics tries to predict future economic trends
- **Cause and Effect:** Studies relationships between economic variables

#### **Differences from Natural Sciences:**
- **Human Behavior:** Deals with unpredictable human choices and emotions
- **No Laboratory:** Cannot conduct controlled experiments like chemistry
- **Multiple Variables:** Many factors influence economic outcomes simultaneously
- **Value Judgments:** Often involves subjective opinions about what's "good" for society

#### **Examples:**
- **Like Science:** Economists can predict that raising minimum wage might increase unemployment
- **Unlike Science:** Cannot predict exactly how much unemployment will increase because humans react differently

#### **Conclusion:**
Economics is a **social science** that uses scientific methods to study human economic behavior, but with limitations due to the complexity of human nature.

---

## **MICROECONOMICS VS MACROECONOMICS**

Economics is divided into two main branches that study different scales of economic activity:

#### **Microeconomics**
- **Definition:** Studies individual economic units and their behavior
- **Focus Areas:**
  - Consumer behavior and demand theory
  - Producer behavior and supply theory
  - Market structures (perfect competition, monopoly, etc.)
  - Price determination in individual markets
  - Resource allocation at firm/household level
- **Real-world Examples:**
  - Why does the price of onions increase during floods?
  - How does a garment factory decide how many workers to hire?
  - What determines the rent of an apartment in Dhanmondi?

#### **Macroeconomics**
- **Definition:** Studies the economy as a whole system
- **Focus Areas:**
  - National income and GDP measurement
  - Unemployment and employment policies
  - Inflation and price level changes
  - Economic growth and development
  - Government fiscal and monetary policies
  - International trade and exchange rates
- **Real-world Examples:**
  - Why is Bangladesh's GDP growing at 6-7% annually?
  - How does the central bank control inflation?
  - What causes unemployment during economic recessions?

| **Microeconomics**                               | **Macroeconomics**                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Looks at small units: individuals, firms, prices | Looks at the whole economy: national income, unemployment |
| Example: Price of rice, income of a farmer       | Example: Bangladesh's total GDP or inflation              |is economics chapter together ‚Äî step by step, just like you asked. We‚Äôll start with a brief **introduction**, then go serially through each topic in clear, friendly language.

### 2. **Is Economics a Science?**

Yes, because it uses **observation and logic** like science. But unlike physics or chemistry, economics deals with **human behavior**, which can‚Äôt be tested in a lab.

---

### 3. **Methods in Economics**

* **Deductive Method:** Start with a general rule ‚Üí apply it to specific cases.
  (e.g. ‚ÄúAll men are mortal‚Äù ‚Üí ‚ÄúRahim is mortal.‚Äù)

* **Inductive Method:** Start from real-life cases ‚Üí create a general conclusion.
  (e.g. Survey students ‚Üí conclude about English proficiency.)

- Same product can have different utility for different people
- Utility can change over time for the same person

#### **Real-life Examples:**
- üñä A pen has high utility for a student taking exams, but zero utility for a baby
- üçï Pizza has high utility when you're hungry, low utility when you're full
- ‚òÇÔ∏è An umbrella has high utility during monsoon, low utility in winter
- üì± A smartphone has high utility for a teenager, moderate utility for elderly

#### **Utility vs. Value:**

### 10. **Wants**

#### **Definition:**
Wants are human **desires for goods and services** that provide satisfaction or utility. They arise from a feeling of lacking something.

#### **Characteristics of Wants:**

##### **1. Unlimited in Aggregate**
- Human wants as a whole can never be completely satisfied
- When one want is satisfied, new wants emerge
- Example: After buying a basic phone, you want a smartphone; after smartphone, you want the latest model

##### **2. Limited in Intensity**
- Each specific want has a limit
- We reach a saturation point for individual wants
- Example: You can only eat a limited amount of food before feeling full

##### **3. Recurring Nature**
- Many wants come back after some time
- Basic wants like food, sleep repeat daily
- Example: Hunger returns every few hours

##### **4. Complementary Wants**
- Some wants are satisfied together
- One want leads to another related want
- Examples:
  - Tea + Sugar + Milk
  - Car + Petrol + Insurance
  - House + Furniture + Electricity

##### **5. Competitive Wants**
- Alternative wants that compete for the same resources

#### **Hierarchy of Wants (Maslow's Theory):**
1. **Physiological:** Food, water, sleep
2. **Safety:** Security, shelter
3. **Social:** Love, belonging
4. **Esteem:** Recognition, status
5. **Self-actualization:** Personal growth

Features:

* Unlimited
* Specific wants are limited (we stop wanting food after we're full)
* Complementary (sugar + tea)
* Competitive (tea or coffee)
